# FAST_Miner
FAST FRB offline Pipeline. This Pipeline can do a search using multi-GPU nodes simultaneously, each with 2 RTX2080 GPU cards.  
This Pipeline use Heimdall for dedispersing and Signal extracting between multi-beams. I also develop a plotting tool for the result review wchih can satisfied various demands of search.
I call this pipeline as FAST_Miner, When a FRB candidate have been found , this Pipeline will generate a Gold file and do some painting for it. This Pipeline already found 4 obviously FRBs and some of Pulsars and FRB candidates(Show in below figure, the FAST new FRB181130). Hope you could have fun on this Pipe.  
  
Sincerely,  
FRB Huntter,
